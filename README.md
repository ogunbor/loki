# LOKI 🔒

LOKI is an on-chain escrow and staking system built on Solana using Pinocchio. It enables users to lock their SOL for a minimum period (e.g., 30 days), rewarding or penalizing them based on the price movement of SOL between the time of deposit and withdrawal.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Lock SOL for a minimum of 30 days
- 📈 Earn dynamic rewards if SOL appreciates during the lock period
- ⚠️ Lose 10% of staked amount if unstaked early
- 💰 Transparent price tracking using the Pyth Oracle
- 🏆 Top staker tracking (amount and time-based)
- 🛠️ Written entirely in Rust with Pinocchio
